/** Describes how the response body of a [[StreamRequest]] should be handled.
  *
  * The stream response can be mapped over, to support custom types. The mapping can take into account the
  * [[ResponseMetadata]], that is the headers and status code.
  *
  * A number of `asStream[Type]` helper methods are available as part of [[SttpApi]] and when importing
  * `sttp.client4._`.
  *
  * @tparam T
  *   Target type as which the response will be read.
  * @tparam S
  *   The type of stream, used to receive the response body bodies.
