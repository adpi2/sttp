/** Describes how the response of a [[WebSocketRequest]] should be handled.
  *
  * The websocket response can be mapped over, to support custom types. The mapping can take into account the
  * [[ResponseMetadata]], that is the headers and status code. Responses can also be handled depending on the response
  * metadata.
  *
  * A number of `asWebSocket` helper methods are available as part of [[SttpApi]] and when importing `sttp.client4._`.
  *
  * @tparam T
  *   Target type as which the response will be read.
